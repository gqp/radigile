# Radigile - A New Era of Team Growth

## Description
Agile is more than a framework—it’s a mindset, a culture, a continuous journey of improvement. Yet, too many teams struggle to measure their progress, identify their blind spots, and turn Agile theory into meaningful practice. We’re changing that.

Our **Agile Maturity Assessment Tool** is built for teams who believe that Agile is more than just stand-ups and sprints—it’s about **relentless experimentation**, **continuous learning**, and **real transformation**. Through **precision assessments**, **visual insights**, and **expert-driven feedback**, we empower teams to break through plateaus, uncover anti-patterns, and take actionable steps toward high performance.

But we’re not stopping there. Our future vision is bold. With **Generative AI**, we will revolutionize how teams assess and improve, dynamically tailoring assessments and providing intelligent, context-aware coaching at scale. Imagine a tool that not only measures where you are—but actively guides you to where you need to be.

This isn’t just an assessment—it’s an evolution engine for Agile teams. And we’re building it **open-source**, together—because real Agile transformation isn’t owned by one company, it’s driven by a community that refuses to settle.

If you believe Agile can be better, if you know teams deserve more than checklists and rigid frameworks—this is your moment. **Join us. Shape the future.** Let’s build something that truly helps teams thrive.
